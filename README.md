This is a tool to help beginners in accounting。😀

When I first came into contact with accounting knowledge, I used some online tools to watch online courses, calculated data through calculators, and read accounting news through news websites. 
However, there was no comprehensive tool for accounting learning that I wanted, so I wrote this tool to help more friends who want to understand and learn accounting knowledge get started faster.
I hope it can be helpful to everyone. If you have any questions, you can actively submit an issue！
